Here's an **updated README.md** including the **diagonal movements** (Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, Down-Right) and a **Fire action** when opening the index finger.

# 🎮 Gesture-Controlled Smash Chart Game  
🚀 **Play games using just your head or hand movements!**  

This project implements a **gesture-based controller** using **OpenCV & MediaPipe**, allowing you to **control in-game actions with simple body or head movements**—no keyboard or mouse required!  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Gesture-Based Controls** – Move in **eight directions (Up, Down, Left, Right, Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, Down-Right)** using simple body or head movements.  
✅ **Fire Action** – Raise your **index finger** to trigger an **in-game fire action** (e.g., shooting or attacking).  
✅ **Intelligent Screen Zones** – The screen is divided into **eight directional zones** for accurate movement detection.  
✅ **Real-Time Processing** – Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for smooth, low-latency gameplay.  
✅ **Multi-Threaded Input Handling** – Ensures responsiveness without lag.  
✅ **Hands-Free Accessibility** – Play without needing traditional controls!

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **OpenCV** 🎥 (for real-time video processing)  
- **MediaPipe** ✋ (for hand & motion tracking)  
- **pynput** ⌨️ (for keyboard input simulation)  
- **Threading** 🧵 (for smoother key handling)  

---

## 🎯 How It Works  
1. **Screen Division** – The game screen is divided into **eight directional zones**:  
   - **Up (↑)**
   - **Down (↓)**
   - **Left (←)**
   - **Right (→)**
   - **Up-Left (↖)**
   - **Up-Right (↗)**
   - **Down-Left (↙)**
   - **Down-Right (↘)**  
2. **Movement Detection** – The system tracks **head and hand movements** to determine your action.  
3. **Fire Action** – If the **index finger is raised**, a **fire action** (e.g., shooting) is triggered.  
4. **Key Simulation** – Detected gestures are mapped to **in-game controls** (e.g., moving left when tilting head left).  
5. **Real-Time Execution** – Using multi-threading, keypress events are **executed seamlessly** for smooth gameplay.

## 🎮 Gesture-to-Action Mapping  
| Gesture | Action |  
|---------|--------|  
| Head Left | Move Left (←) |  
| Head Right | Move Right (→) |  
| Head Up | Move Up (↑) |  
| Head Down | Move Down (↓) |  
| Tilt Head Up-Left | Move Up-Left (↖) |  
| Tilt Head Up-Right | Move Up-Right (↗) |  
| Tilt Head Down-Left | Move Down-Left (↙) |  
| Tilt Head Down-Right | Move Down-Right (↘) |  
| Raise Index Finger | **Fire / Attack** (Spacebar or Mouse Click) |
